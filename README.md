Transaction testing for atomacity, consistancy, isolation and durability
Hello Transaction testing are great for financial real time transactions. 
I do want to work on the real time transactions on distributed, cross platform systems 
The project here will be demostrating the RPC calls and WS-* microservices across the multiple enterprise systems.

Good Luck!!
